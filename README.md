A plan to codify the OpenVote Protocol

As with Election Ballot Votes, Open Votes consist of 3 variables: X, Y & Z, Representing Name, Time and Idea respectively.                                                      
                                                           
                                                           
                                                         Welcome to Team X 
                                                           
                    	To prevent voting fraud, Team X will ensure that all users go through a manual verification as well as an autoverification utiliizing GPG Keys combined with DHT. This will ensure that all votes are fair, and will deter criminals from exploitiing our services. Top Priorities are the same as the Election: Voter Privacy, Authentication, Conflict Resolution, Accountability, etc. Team X is responsible for advancing Voters Rights in correspondence with OpenVote. Local Libraries, Volunteers, Churches, etc can assist unprivlidged Citizens with Access to OpenVotes. Active Updating of Black/White Lists will provide an extra layer of damage mitigation in the event of a technical or social vulnerability.

                                                       	Welcome to Team Y
                                                           
                    	 In the beginning, OpenVote will be accessible through IRC protocol, through a mandatory secure SSL connection. To further ensure fairness in voting, all votes will be securely live fed into a "Looking Glass" through HTTPS. Furthermore, to prevent DDoS all IP addresses of servers will be effectively hidden through the extensive use of reverse-proxies not only with IRC but with also the Looking Glass. Team Y is responsible for advancing the technical security and accessability of the Record protocol in correspondence with OpenVote.

                                                       	Welcome to Team Z
                                                           
                    	Open 3rd party adoption of Open Votes are the top priority of Team Z. Users of Internet Communities like Reddit, Twitter, Wikipedia, Facebook, USAGOV, IRCs, Google, etc can lobby for more access to OpenVoting and a wide variety of support functions: Current Trend Analysis, Campaign Proposals, Cross-Platforming Support, Education Tools, etc. Majority Ratification of the Open Vote Protocol on November 5th and 6th will be best for wide adoption and a sense of solidarity. OpenVoting Fair helps everyone.
